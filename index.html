            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Ez-SacCO app was an idea brought up by Muhammad during the period of COVID-19 in 2020.As the president's directives indicated, 
			  public transport was put at a stand still,SACCO companies were closed and people found it difficult to accesss the services of 
			  these SACCO groups. 
			  
			  
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              This is where the idea of the application came from to enable people accesss SACCO services even if such emergencies happen to 
			  hit the country again. And even to ease people's lives through saving even when one is at his/her place.

            <p class="text">
              The risk of thefty is solved since a person doesnot move with a lot of money to SACCO offices but just needs 
			  mobile money and an account in the SACCO group to save at any time.

              If you don’t earn much and you can barely pay your bills, the idea of saving money might seem laughable. When you only have little left at the end of the month, why even bother to try saving? Because everyone has to start somewhere, and if you work at it, your financial situation is likely to improve over time. Saving money is worth the effort. It gives you peace of mind, it gives you options, and the more you save, the easier it becomes to accumulate additional savings.

              Peace of Mind
              Who hasn’t lain awake at 3:00 a.m. wondering how they were going to afford something they needed? If money is really tight, you might be wondering how you’re going to pay the rent next week. If you’re a little further up the financial ladder, you might be worried about how many months you could pay the bills if you lost your job. Later in life, the money thoughts that keep you up at night might center around paying for your kids to go to college or having enough money to retire.

              As you accumulate savings, your financial worries should diminish, as long as you’re living within your means. If you already have next month’s rent taken care of by the first week of the current month, if you know you can get by without work for three to six months, if you have savings accounts for your children’s education and your own retirement that you’re regularly funding, you’ll sleep better at night. The reduced stress from having money in the bank frees up your energy for more enjoyable thoughts and activities. Finding the best savings account is key to making sure that the money that you do put away earns you the highest interest.

              Expanded Options
             The more money you have saved, the more you control your own destiny. If your job has you on the verge of a nervous breakdown, you can quit, even if you don’t have a new job lined up yet, and take time off to restore your sanity before you look for new employment. If you’re tired of living in an unsafe neighborhood, you can move to a safer area because you’ll have enough for a deposit on a better apartment or a down payment on a nicer home.

             If you get sick and need expensive healthcare that your insurance doesn’t cover, you’ll have a way to pay for it even though you can’t work while you’re getting treatment. And knowing that you have options because of the money you’ve socked away can give you even more peace of mind.

             No, money doesn’t solve every problem. If you are laid off, it might take as long as two years to find a new job. Some illnesses won’t go away no matter how many procedures you can afford, and random crime can happen even in a supposedly secure, gated community. But with more money in the SACCO to deal with issues like these, you give yourself better odds of coming out on top.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              One of the main reasons why people don’t achieve their goals is because we don’t have time to dedicate towards working on our goals.  Once we have a detailed plan with a target date and we have freed up the time to work towards our goals we can start saving money for our goals.This is where the Ez-SacCO idea comes.

             Once we know how much our dream will cost we can start saving towards our goal.  We should Pay Yourself First.  This means that when we get our Paycheck we should put some money aside for personal savings before we pay our bills and other monthly expenses. This ensures that we are always saving on a continuous basis towards our personal goals.  Even saving 5000 shs per month can add up over time as a nice nest egg to help us achieve our goals.

             We can also save in reverse. If we know how much our dream will cost and we have set a target date then we can divide our monthly savings into equal payments over the amount of time until we reach our target goal date.
